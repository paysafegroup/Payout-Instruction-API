# Payout Instruction API

The Payout Instruction API provides our Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) / Partners with the ability to control the frequency of payouts to its merchants and define the payout amounts. Payout instructions submitted through the API are processed daily and paid out to merchants according to their funding schedule. The execution of these payout instructions is dependent on sufficient funds being available in the Merchant Account balance. In addition, the API response (whether successful or failed) displays the remaining Merchant Account balance for easy reconciliation for ISVs / Partners.

The benefits of this product is to allow our ISVs / Partners to circumvent any reconciliation challenges that their merchants may be presented with due to factors such as time zone differences, late business hours (e.g., bars/restaurants), irregular service policies / sales processes, etc. To take advantage of the benefits provided by the Payout Instruction API, ISVs / Partners are required to be:

+ Operating through a Managed PayFac model
+ Using Fee Redirect services
+ Able to provide direct reporting/reconciliation to their merchants
